# Motivaing question:
# Is there an observable difference in baby weight for smokers / non-smokers?

# Install/library the `openintro` package
# install.packages('openintro')
# You'll also want to load dplyr and ggplot2 (as usual)

# You should now be able to `View` the `births` dataset

# Make an overlapping histogram of the birth weights of smokers/non-smokers
# This is assessing the univariate distribution by a categorical variable

# What are the mean birth weights for smokers/non-smokers

# Is this difference statistically significant (to be answered via steps below)?

# Pre-t-test conceptaul question: is this data paired?

# Store weights from smokers/non-smokers in separate variables for easier access

# Implement a t-test to assess the significance of this difference

# Bonus: let's calculate the t value and confidence intervals manually

# Compute the difference in means

# Calculate the standard error

# Compute the t score

# Compute CIs using t score (you'll need to reference a t table)
